CoreAlpha Data Science Internship Task 4 – Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

# Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning | CoreAlpha Data Science Internship

## Project Overview

This project is a part of the **CoreAlpha Data Science Internship**.
The task focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails
as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** based on their textual content.

Email spam detection is a real-world application of natural language processing (NLP)
and machine learning, widely used to filter unwanted emails.

## Problem Statement

Spam emails are unsolicited messages sent in bulk and can cause security risks
and productivity loss.

The objective of this task is to develop a machine learning model
that can accurately identify spam emails using text-based features.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains email messages and their corresponding labels.
It includes:

* Email text/content
* Label indicating spam or ham

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is used for training
and testing the classification model.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
* Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

* Imported required Python libraries
* Loaded the email dataset
* Performed text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming)
* Converted text data into numerical form using vectorization techniques
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Built a machine learning classification model
* Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results

The trained machine learning model successfully classified emails
into spam and non-spam categories with high accuracy.

## Conclusion

This task provided practical experience in text preprocessing,
natural language processing, and classification modeling using Python.
It enhanced understanding of how machine learning is applied
in real-world spam detection systems as part of the **CoreAlpha Data Science Internship**.
